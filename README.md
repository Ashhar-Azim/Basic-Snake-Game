## Snake (the game itself)

Snake is a game in which a snake needs to explore an environment and catch the fruit without hitting any obstacle or itself. Every time the snake catches a fruit, its size increases.

## How to Play

- Use the arrow keys to control the snake's direction.
- Press the spacebar to pause the game.
- Press the escape key to reset the game.

## Gameplay Features

- The snake grows longer as it eats fruits.
- The game ends if the snake collides with its own tail or the walls.
- The top score achieved is displayed during gameplay.
- The game interface provides visual cues for the available actions.

## Implementation Details

The game is implemented using a simple JavaScript-based game loop. The snake's movement and growth are handled through a trail mechanism, while the fruit's appearance and collision detection are managed within the game loop. The game supports different settings, such as wall collision toggling and fixed or variable tail size.

## How to Run

To run the game, simply open the `index.html` file in a web browser.

## Game Controls

- Use the arrow keys to control the snake.
- Press the spacebar to pause the game.
- Press the escape key to reset the game.

## Note

This project is for educational purposes and serves as a basic implementation of a Snake game in JavaScript and HTML5 Canvas.
